        <br>
        <h4> SECTION 1</h4>
        <h4>Reading Passage (1−13)</h4>
        <h5> You are advised to spend 20 minutes on Questions 1−13 which are based on
          Reading Passage below.</h5><br>
        <div style="text-align: center  ;">
          <h5> <strong> Food for thought</strong></h5>
          <h5>Nowadays, you not only are what you eat; you R&amp;D* what you eat.</h5>
          <br>
        </div>
        <p>
          To cajole nervous students into the chemistry laboratory, teachers used to say that the subject was like
          cooking. These days, it is truer to say that cooking is like chemistry. In a cut-throat market, food
          companies are unwilling to leave anything to chance. They must constantly formulate new flavours,
          ingredients and processing methods if they are to keep abreast of their competitors.</p>
        <p>
          As a result, their research laboratories have never been busier. A study published in November by a trade
          magazine showed that 42% of the 331 food manufactures surveyed had plans to increase their R&amp;D
          budgets by at least 15% in the coming year; only 3% said that their R&amp;D budgets would drop. This
          money has spurred the development of new ideas in food technology.</p>
        <p>
          To lower cost or improve texture, food manufacturers often have to replace one substance by another that
          tastes nothing like it. One popular substitution is soya protein for meat. In addition to being cheaper
          than meat, soya has (at least in America) the added advantage of being marketable. The country's Food
          and Drug Administration, which regulates such matters, has recently decided that if a foodstuff
          contains more than 6.25g of soya per serving, manufacturers can state on its label that eating soya may
          reduce the risk of heart disease.</p>
        <p>
          That is a nice bonus. Unclogged arteries are not, however, the main point of eating hamburgers. Flavour is.
          So, to find out how far hamburgers can be 'extended' with soya, Keith Cadwallader of the University of
          Illinois at Urbana-Champaign analysed differences between the aromas of pure beef hamburgers and
          those containing 25% soya protein. Surprisingly (and gratifyingly), adding a bit of soya to a hamburger
          may actually improve its flavour. The mixed burgers had higher levels of certain sulphur-containing
          compounds that are believed to augment the meaty 'notes' in a burger's aroma.</p>
        <p>
          On the other hand, the research of Margaret Hinds at Oklahoma State University shows what a fine line
          there is between temptation and disdain. Using a group of 81 untrained testers, she conducted a
          comparison of five commercially available burgers made from soya (and one made from beef, as a
          control). The hue, the firmness and the chewiness of the burgers correlated with how acceptable they
          were to consumers. Not surprisingly, consumers preferred burgers that had characteristics close to
          those of beef. Only one soya-based burger was close enough to pass muster.</p>
        <p>
          Food, and its consumers, are notoriously subject to fads. This year, flavour makers are insisting that bolder
          tastes are in fashion. Frito-Lay, a snack-food maker, has recently launched a line of 'gourmet' crisps
          designed to appeal to the more discerning consumer. The company's laboratory started by generating 300
          flavours, including Thai curry, blue cheese, lemongrass and tandoori chicken. Eight of these flavours made it
          to the final round and, after getting 400 consumers to sample them, Frito-Lay decided to mass-produce only
          four: cheddar and jalapeno; garlic and herb; barbecue; and something referred to as 'classic'. This quartet
          seemed to please the American palate most.</p>
        <p>That sort of market research, though is both time-consuming and expensive. It would speed things up, and
          probably cut costs, if it could be mechanised. To a certain extent, it can be. Cheddar cheese, coffee and
          tea researchers are all exploring the use of electronic noses to rate their foodstuffs. Simple versions of
          such devices employ a set of sensors made of special polymers linked to electrodes. The volatile
          compounds that make up an aroma cause these polymers to change shape, which alters the resistance
          to the current passing through the electrodes. The result is an electrical 'fingerprint' of an aroma.</p>
        <p>
          So far, the electronic noses developed by firms such as Alpha MOS, of Toulouse, France, have worked best
          for quality-control purposes. These machines compare products' aroma-fingerprints with pre-
          programmed standards that are known to correspond with what people have said that they like. And
          the range of senses that can be substituted electronically has now been extended to include taste as well
          as smell. Recently, Alpha MOS has launched a second analyzer − an electronic 'tongue' that can
          fingerprint the compounds dissolved in a sample of liquid. The machine is accurate enough to work out,
          for example, whether the vanilla extract in a sample originated in India or in Malaysia.</p>
        <p>
          Even in culinary matters, however, the proof of the pudding is not always in the eating. The success of a
          food product also depends on the cleverness of its marketing. To this end McCormick, a flavouring
          company based in Maryland, has commissioned a 'craveability' study from Moskowitz and Jacobs, a
          market-research firm in White Plains, New York. The intention is to discover which descriptions of
          particular foods most induce craving in consumers. The preliminary results show that for fast-food
          hamburgers, the descriptions rates as most enticing were 'a grilled aroma that surrounds a thick
          burger on a toasted bun' and 'lots of grilled bacon and cheese covering on a lightly toasted bun'. Other
          blurbs, such as 'with horseradish sauce' and when it's cold outside and the burger is warm and
          inviting', actually put people off hamburgers. And that was before they knew what was in them.</p>

              <h5> <strong> For 80 cents more</strong></h5>
              <h5>Even a tiny health budget, if spent well, can make a difference</h5>
            </div>
            <ol type="A">
              <li>
                Delivering medicine to the world's poorest people is a challenge. Hot poor places such as Tanzania
                have
                many microbes but microscopic health budgets. Dangerous myths deter many sick rural folk from
                seeking medical help. Even if they do seek help, it is often unavailable, for they do not have the money
                to pay for it, and their government rarely has the money to give it to them for free. Because they
                cannot
                afford adequate health care, poor people are sick a lot of the time. And because they are sick a lot of
                the
                time, they find it hard to put in the long hours of productive labour that might make them less poor.
              </li>
              <li>
                All hope is not lost, however. A recent experiment in Tanzania has shown that a small health budget
                can go a long way, provided that the money is spent with care. With the help of a Canadian charity
                called the International Development Research Center (IDRC), the Tanzanian health ministry set up a
                health project in two rural districts, to the west of the capital Dar es Salaam, with a combined
                population of about 700,000. Five years ago, annual health spending in Tanzania was about $8 a head.
                This figure included an estimate for the annual cost of trained staff and buildings devoted to health
                care. The IDRC added $2 a head to the pot, on condition that it was spent rationally. By this, the
                donors meant that the amount of money spent on fighting a particular disease should reflect the burden
                that disease imposed on the local population.
              </li>
              <li>
                This may sound obvious; however, in this region, no one had a clue with diseases caused the most
                trouble, so the first task was to find out. Researchers were sent out on bicycles to carry out a
                door-to-
                door survey, asking representative households whether anyone had been ill or died recently, and if so
                with what symptoms. These raw numbers were then crunched to produce a 'burden of disease' profile
                for the two districts. In other words, researchers sought to measure how many years of life were being
                lost to each disease, including the damage done to families when breadwinners 1 die.
              </li>
              <li>
                They then compared their results with the amount spent by the local health authorities on each disease
                and found that it bore no relation whatsoever to the harm which the disease inflicted on local people.
                Some diseases were horribly neglected, such as malaria, which accounted for 30% of the years of life
                lost but only 5% of the health budget. A cluster of childhood problems, including pneumonia,
                diarrhoea, malnutrition and measles, constituted 28% of the disease burden, but received only 13% of
                the budget. Other conditions, meanwhile, attracted more than their fair share of cash. Tuberculosis,
                which accounted for less than 4% of years of life lost, received 22% of the budget. Vaccinations also
                appeared to be over-emphasised though the low incidence of vaccine-preventable disease was probably
                a result of successful vaccination.
              </li>
              <li>
                This tiny infusion of cash from the Canadians, in the form of an extra $2 a head, was enough to allow
                the district health authorities to make their spending reflect the disease burden and smoothed the
                transition to a more effective approach to health care. Health workers, mostly nurses or paramedics
                rather than doctors, were given a set of rules on how to treat common symptoms. For examples, if a
                child arrives coughing, and with a running nose and a hot brow, the nurse is instructed to work
                through the checklist of other symptoms to determine whether it is merely a cold or something worse. If
                the child is breathing more than 50 times a minute, for example, he is assumed to have pneumonia,
                given an antibiotic and checked again after two days. In most cases, the cheapest treatments are offered
                first. Children with diarrhoea are given oral re-hydration salts, which cost a few cents. If the salts
                fail
                to work, the child is referred to a clinic for treatment.
              </li>
              <li>
                Drugs are ordered according to what is needed; previously, the government had sent out the same
                package of pills to all areas. Non-malarial mountain villages received as many malaria drugs as
                mosquito-infected lowland ones, and areas where no one had ever suffered from asthma received
                asthma pills. In addition to the improved drug allocation, people are now encouraged to use bednets
                impregnated with insecticide as protection from mosquitoes and even the Masai, a fiercely conservative
                tribe of nomadic cattle-herders, have started draping themselves in insecticide-soaked bendets.</li>

                The results of all this were stunning. Infant mortality fell by 28% between 1999 and 2000 and the
                proportion of children dying before their fifth birthday dropped by 14%. In nearby districts and in
                Tanzania as a whole, there is no evidence of a similar improvement over the same period, and
                anecdotal evidence suggests that better health has made the districts less poor. Could this success be
                repeated elsewhere?

            <p>The government is keen that the lessons learned be applied in other parts of the country. So keen, in
              fact, that it is pushing the organisers to move faster than they would prefer. Other countries could also
              copy the Tanzanian model and donors should pay heed that, while more money is certainly needed to
              tackle poor countries' health problems, how it is spent is more important than how much is spent.</p>

              20
              ____________________ may prevent people from seeing a doctor. When they do, there is limited money
              available for treatment. The $8 a head formerly spent in Tanzania included an allocation for trained
              staff as well as for 21 ____________________ . The IDRC offered to increase this by 22

            <p>Research showed that the 23 ____________________ in Tanzania had been unevenly distributed in previous
              years so strategies were implemented to help redress this. The project has shown that improvement in

            <div style="text-align: center  ;">
              <h5> <strong>How does the human brains process language?</strong></h5>
              <h5>New studies into the use of sign language hint at an answer</h5>
              <br>
            </div>
            <p>One of the great mysteries of the human brain is how it understands and produces language. Until
              recently,
              most of the research on this subject had been based on the study of spoken languages: English, French,
              German and the like. Starting in the mid-19th century, scientists made large strides in identifying the
              regions of the brain involved in speech. For example, in 1861 the French neurologist Paul Broca
              discovered that patients who could understand spoken language but had difficulty speaking tended to
              have damage to a part of the brain's left hemisphere, later known as Broca's area. And in 1874 German
              physician Carl Wernicke found that patient with fluent speech but severe comprehension
              problems typically had damage to another part of the left hemisphere, which was then called
              Wernicke's area.</p>
            <p>Similar damage to the brain's right hemisphere only very rarely results in such language disruptions,
              which are called 'aphasias'. Instead right hemisphere damage is more often associated with severe
              visual-spatial problems, such as the inability to copy a simple line drawing. For these reasons, the left
              hemisphere is often branded the verbal hemisphere and the right hemisphere the spatial hemisphere.
              Although this dichotomy 1 is an oversimplification, it does capture some of the main clinical differences
              between individuals with damage to the left side of the brain and those with damage to the right.</p>
            <p>Nevertheless, many puzzles remain. One that has been particularly hard to crack is why language
              establishes itself in the brain where it does. The locations of Wernicke's and Broca's areas seem to
              make sense; Wernicke's area, involved in speech comprehension, is located near the part of the brain
              that receives signals from the ear. Broca's area, involved in speech production, is located next to the
              part of the brain that controls the muscles of the mouth and lips. But is the brain's organisation for
              language truly based on the functions of hearing and speaking? One way to explore this question is to
              study a language that uses different sensory and motor channels. Reading and writing, of course,
              employ vision for comprehension and hand movements for expression, but for most people these
              activities depend, at least in part, on brain systems involved in the use of a spoken language. The sign
              languages of the deaf, however, precisely fit the bill and are therefore perfect for such research.</p>
            <p>Many people mistakenly believe that sign language is just a loose collection of pantomime-like gestures
              thrown together willy-nilly to allow rudimentary communication. But, in truth, sign languages are
              highly structured linguistic systems with all the grammatical complexity of spoken languages. Just as
              spoken languages have elaborate rules for forming words and sentences, sing languages have rules for
              individual signs and signed sentences. Contrary to another common misconception, there is no
              universal sign language. Deaf people in different countries use very different sign languages. In fact, a
              deaf singer 2 who acquires a second sign language as an adult will actually sign with a foreign accent!
              Moreover, sign languages are not simply manual versions of the spoken languages that are used in their
              surrounding communities. American Sign Language (ASL) and British Sign Language, for example,
              are mutually incomprehensible; in other words, users of these different languages cannot understand
              one another.</p>
            <p>Spoken and sign languages share the abstract properties of language but differ radically in their outward
              form. Spoken languages involve the creation of vocal sounds made one after the other, while sign
              languages rely on visual-spatial changes, i.e. actions and movements, to signal linguistic contrasts. But
              there are also similarities. Sign languages, like spoken languages, have several kinds of linguistic
              structure, including phonological (sound), morphological (form) and syntactic (grammar) levels. Just as
              spoken words are composed of a small set of consonants and vowels, signs are made up of a small set of
              components which include hand shapes, the locations around the body where signs are made, the
              movements of the hands and arms and the orientation of the hands. So location of a sign is a critical
              element in conveying meaning. For example, palm up versus palm down. In American Sign Language
              the sings for the words 'summer', 'ugly' and 'dry' have the same hand shape, movement and orientation, but
              differ in location. 'Summer' is articulated near the forehead, 'ugly' near the nose and
              'dry' near the chin.</p>
            <p>At the morphological level, ASL has grammatical markers that systematically change the meaning of sings.
              In English these include fragments like 'ed' which can be added to most verbs to indicate past tense.
              However, in ASL the signs are modified using distinctive spatial patterns or types of movement. At the
              syntactical level, ASL specifies the grammatical relations among signs in ways that do not occur in
              spoken languages. In English, for instance, meaning is often embedded in word order. Take the
              example 'Mary criticised John'. Reverse the order of the names, and you reverse the meaning of the
              sentence. Signers of ASL can use word-order cues as well, but they need not. Instead they can point to a
              distinct position in space while signing a noun, thus linking the word with that position. Then the signer
              can move the verb sign from Mary's position to John's to mean 'John criticised Mary' and in the other
              direction to mean the reverse.</p>
            <p>Over the past two decades, we have examined groups of deaf people who communicate through sign
              language, and who have suffered damage to either the right or the left hemisphere of their brains,
              mostly as a result of a stroke. By evaluating their proficiency at understanding and producing signs, we
              set out to determine whether the brain regions that interpret and generate sign language are the same
              ones involved in spoken language. The surprising results have illuminated the workings of the human
              brain and may help neurologists treat the ills of their deaf patients.</p>
